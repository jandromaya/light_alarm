# Lights and Alarm system
This is a personal project with two functions:
   1. Lets me control my lights remotely (i.e., from my bed) using a remote control so I don't have to get up.
   2. Turns on all the lights in my room at a time that I can set from a website (to help me wake up in the morning).

## Why did I make this?
For fun. I'm lazy and don't want to leave my cozy bed at night to turn off the lights, and it's dark when I get up in the morning, so the alarm clock feature helps me wake up.

## Relevant Resources 
To build this, I mainly used ESP's examples, customizing them to fit my needs. Namely, I used:
   - mcpwm_servo_control
   - http_request
   - sntp
   - wifi
   - ir_nec_transceiver

This is a work in progress. Check back later for a more up-to-date README. Thank you for checking out my GitHub!
